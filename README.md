### â€” Hey!

My name is Volodymyr and this here is my website. I've decided to host it with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), because it's so much easier, cost efficient, and saves me time on deployments _(since I have none of them)_. I've also bought a domain name on [**Google Domains**](https://domains.google/) for $12/year and I find this service to be very convenient as well. Other than that it's just good old plain HTML and CSS with a very little bit of JavaScript.
