### ‚Äî Hey, hi!
My name is Volodymyr and this here is my website.  
I've decided to host it with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), because it's so much easier, cost efficient, and saves me time on deployments _(since I have none of them, kinda)_. I've also bought a domain name on [**Google Domains**](https://domains.google/) for $12/year and I find this service to be very convenient as well. Other than that it's just good old plain HTML and CSS with a very little bit of JavaScript. `<head>` is built using excellent [**HEAD**](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for reference, `<body>` uses some of the styles from the great [**Semantic UI**](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) framework. Website is frequently tested with [**Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) automated tool. Amazing [**Workbox**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) helps build a decent Service Worker for this website _(hence it even works offline)_. I could set up a build process based on Git prepush hook in order to generate new Service Worker every time I'm about to push my code to GitHub, but I choose to keep things minimal and run `workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` manually _([**workbox**](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox) npm package is installed globally; by the way, I also use [**serve**](https://github.com/zeit/serve) as a local development webserver)_. 

_‚ÄúThat's all Folks!‚Äù_ <sup>üê∑</sup>
